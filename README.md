# DBMS-Excel-Sheet
This project compares four DBMS options (A to D) based on performance, cost, maintenance time, and men required. Using SUMIF formulas, I calculated a performance-to-resource ratio (Rating) and identified the best DBMS. Results are visualized through a clustered column chart for easy comparison.
